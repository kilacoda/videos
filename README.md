# videos

This repo is intended to contain the source code for the videos I post on [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/kilacoda) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYiEcjVorHS78RgoqKiIFgQ), alongwith the reference images and materials I use (primarily so I can work on multiple computers and when I'm on the road). All files are intended to work with [ManimCE](https://github.com/manimcommunity/manim), though some may require slight modifications to work with the latest versions. Feel free to open an issue or PR if you think something of the sort is required.
